        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
        would be like building a house. HTML is the main structure such as the
        walls and roof, CSS is the decoration like furniture and paint, and
        JavaScript is like the electricity and heating.

        Control flow is the step-by-step process of how code is run, and loops
        are code that repeats until a certain condition is met. In real life,
        control flow would be similar to a food recipe, while loops can be
        something like heating water until it's boiling or stirring the pot
        until the desired consistency.

        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a map of a webpage. It turns
        everything into objects so that they can be easily changed using
        programming languages such as JavaScript. An example of how you might
        interact with it is by using the <em>`document`</em> object to access
        and manipulate specific elements. This code accesses the first
        <em>`p`</em> element it can find in the HTML:<br /><br /><em
          >`document.querySelector('p').innerHTML`</em
        >
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        Arrays are collections of indexed data while objects are collections of
        name-value pairs.<br />To access data in arrays, you use their index
        which starts from <em>`[0]`</em>:<br /><br /><em
          >`let groceryList = ['Apples', 'Bread', 'Cheese'];<br />console.log(groceryList[0]);`</em
        ><br /><br />To access data in objects, you use their name which gives
        the value they're associated with:<br /><br /><em
          >`let groceryItem = {name: 'Apples', quantity: 5, price: 3.00}<br />console.log(groceryItem.price)`</em
        >
      </li>

        Functions are blocks of code that are designed to do a specific task.
        They are helpful because they are reusable and you can call them as much
        as you like, which makes code easier to maintain by saving time and not
        repeating anything.
