      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because
        it improves our brain’s ability to learn and adapt. It also helps our
        brain heal better from things like a stroke or head injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my own benefit, I will engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
        by practicing known and new coding skills and engaging in meditation
        every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity are getting good sleep,
        continuously learning new things, and trying to get out of your comfort
        zone.

      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        The growth mindset is the belief that one can improve in any area
        despite challenges and setbacks as long as they keep practicing. It’s
        relevant because it helps us become more resilient and not give up when
        we fail and also lets us learn better.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this exploration, what surprised me was how much we can limit
        ourselves just from mindset alone. What changed for me was knowing that
        it’s okay to fail as it helps us get better if we’re consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey by reminding
        myself that it’s okay to not understand things at first and that as long
        as I keep trying I’ll be able to achieve my goals eventually.

      <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
      <p>
        These understandings have shaped my learning plan and strategy by
        encouraging me to try different methods of learning until I find the
        right one for me depending on the goal I’m trying to achieve. By
        understanding that my brain is “malleable” and that I don’t have a fixed
        intelligence motivates me to keep trying and be persistent in learning.
