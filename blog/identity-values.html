        A situation where I made an ethical decision was when I noticed a kid
        fell into the deep end of a pool and I went to go help her. At the time
        I wasn’t “weighing up” any values involved in that decision, I just knew
        it was dangerous for the kid and that I was capable of reaching her.
        Reflecting on it now, I’m glad that I instinctively know what to do and
        that I didn’t hesitate in doing it.

        My Filipino culture and the people around me have influenced my values
        and identity by having a strong emphasis on family, community, and
        respect. This includes supporting and being loyal to my family and
        friends, being polite and respectful both in personal and professional
        settings, and working together with others to achieve a common goal.

        My strengths include an eagerness to learn, persistence and
        adaptability, discipline, and creative problem solving skills. These
        will help my learning experience as I won’t easily give up and am able
        to find other solutions if I get stuck.

        Some limitations I have in terms of my learning and career development
        are perfectionism, time management, and procrastination. They’ve
        affected me by causing delays in submitting work, but I’ve managed to
        improve in those areas using tools and techniques I’ve acquired, such as
        timeboxing and Pomodoro.

        An example of when I was trying to work productively with others, but
        there were problems, was when I was working on a coding project with two
        others at a previous school. One member was struggling in terms of
        technical skill, which hindered our progress. Along with our tutor, I
        would help her learn what she needed for the project. Meanwhile the
        other member wouldn’t respond to my messages. I tried using different
        platforms and telling my tutor about it but we never got a response. In
        the end I found out that he went overseas for vacation in the middle of
        the project and dropped the class. Reflecting on it now, I’m not sure
        what other strategies I could’ve used, as the two members were out of my
        control.
