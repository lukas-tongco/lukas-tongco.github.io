      <h3>Blocked On A Simple Problem</h3>
      <p>
        I had a problem where I was trying to filter out certain words from a
        sentence but it would either keep the words I didn't want or didn't
        filer out everything I wanted it to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The techniques I used to solve this are re-reading each line carefully,
        making sure I knew what each method is supposed to do, and debugging
        constantly using <em>`console.log()`</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt frustrated at first because it seemed so simple but I couldn't
        figure it out right away. I was also determined to solve this problem
        because it felt like the solution was right within reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned that it's good to take breaks and move your eyes away from
        your code, as it allows you to "reset" and see things you easily missed.
        In this case, the problem was just a missing syntax that I didn't see at
        first because I was too focused.
      </p>

      <h3>Elegantly Solved A Problem</h3>
      <p>
        I had a problem where I was given a sentence stored in a string and I
        needed to capitalize the first letter of each word in it. At the time I
        only knew how to capitalize all characters of a single word, so I was a
        bit stumped at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        The techniques I used to solve this are research, experimentation, and
        debugging. From online resources like W3Schools I found that there are
        built-in methods that help with my problem so I implemented them in my
        code in ways that made sense to me. After trial and error I managed to
        solve my problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt very satisfied after figuring out how to solve my problem without
        blatantly copying different code. I was also proud because I was able to
        translate my thought process / pseudocode into actual code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned that there are a lot of built-in methods that can really save
        your time, so before making my own function I should do a little bit of
        research first to see if there are any methods available that let me do
        what I want to do.

      <h3>Problem-Solving Techniques/Processes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I'm confident with <strong>pseudocode</strong> as it lets me lessen
          the load on my brain and I can visually see what I'm trying to
          achieve.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm confident with <strong>"trying something"</strong> as I naturally
          run code a lot just to see what happens.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm okay with the <strong>rubber ducky method</strong>, it's not
          something I keep in mind and is more of a last resort.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm okay with <strong>reading error messages</strong>, it can be a hit
          or miss for me as sometimes I understand what it's saying and
          sometimes I don't. It's mostly useful for figuring out what line the
          error is occurring on.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm confident with <strong>console.logging</strong>, I use it mostly
          for testing a function or specific parts inside a function. It's also
          helpful for making sure I'm passing the right parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm confident with <strong>Googling</strong>, I use it a lot to figure
          out what certain things do but I always make sure I understand what
          I'm researching and not just blindly copying and pasting.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm okay with <strong>asking my peers for help</strong>, it's a last
          resort and I only do it if I'm absolutely stuck and with people I
          trust.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm confident with <strong>asking coaches for help</strong>, if
          they're easy to reach and talk to I will ask for help before I get too
          stuck, I still like to do research by myself first.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm confident with <strong>reflection</strong>, it's very useful as it
          helps me see what I did good and what didn't go so well. It helps me
          improve and be more efficient for next time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reluctance To Ask For Help</h3>
      <p>
        I can't think of a specific scenario but it's definitely something that
        has happened to me before. The main reasons I've been reluctant are
        because I was scared of what people would think of me especially if I
        feel like the task is "easy", and that I was eventually able to complete
        the task by myself. Next time, I have to do a better job of convincing
        myself that it's okay to ask for help no matter what and that most
        questions aren't stupid.
