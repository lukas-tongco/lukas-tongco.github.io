      <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My long term goal is to become a software developer and I'm hoping to
          use the skills I gain in this course for getting a job in the tech
          industry.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I think my biggest strengths and limitations in Bootcamp will still be
          the same as what I had in Foundations, the difference being that the
          human skills I learned will help manage them now.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be
          communication and collaborating in groups. At first I had a hard time
          with scheduling and organizing material but I was able to improve on
          it throughout Foundations.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Human skills I'd like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy
          are mainly communication with both peers and facilitators, I prefer to
          focus on the task at hand by myself which wouldn't be helpful in a
          group setting.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          My expectations from the Bootcamp team are that they'll be able to
          provide help and guide me in the right direction most of the time, and
          that they aren't difficult to approach regarding Bootcamp.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          My expectations of myself are to be able to stay on top of material,
          submitting things on time, and asking for help from peers and
          facilitators when needed. I'll do this by being active on Discord
          while I do work and using techniques such as Pomodoro to help me
          manage my time and stay on track.

      <h2>Foundations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My long term goal / career pathway is to become a software developer
          that can work remotely in order to have more time and flexibility to
          be with my partner and family.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          My strengths include problem-solving, adaptability, and attention to
          detail, while my limitations include perfectionism, procrastination,
          and conflict avoidance.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Skills I’d like to see developed and improved in myself while at Dev
          Academy include leadership, communication, and empathy.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I’ll manage myself to work productively and safely with other
          learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives by using
          the techniques taught to us in previous lessons such as Pomodoro,
          timeboxing, and reflecting on myself. If things are building up and
          starting to get to me, I’ll make sure to take more breaks in order let
          myself rest and recuperate.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I’ll seek help in a timely way by asking for help in the appropriate
          Discord channels from the Facilitators and my classmates before the
          week is over.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I expect the Facilitation team to be able to help me whenever I’m
          stuck or have any problems relating to the Sprints and that I can at
          least reach them during appropriate hours (9:00am - 5:00pm).
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          My block-out times are 8:00am and 3:00pm every weekday as I pick up
          and drop off my brother for school, 4:45pm - 5:45pm every Monday and
          Thursday as I accompany my brother to Kumon (after-school program),
          and 3:45pm - 5:00pm every Tuesday as I accompany my brother to his
          swimming lessons.
