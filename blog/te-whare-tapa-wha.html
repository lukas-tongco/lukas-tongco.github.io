    <h2><em>Wellbeing</em></h2>
    <div class="static">
      <h3>Physical</h3>
      <p>
        To strengthen my wall of physical wellbeing, I play badminton at least
        once a week in order to stay active. I also try my best to go sleep and
        wake up at the same time consistently, and to eat 3-4 meals a day.
      </p>

      <h3>Family</h3>
      <p>
        To strengthen my wall of family wellbeing, I ensure that I eat my meals
        at the same time as my family. When there's a chance, I video-call my
        extended family who lives overseas in order to stay in touch with them.
        I also like to go hang out with my friends.

      <h3>Emotional & Mental</h3>
      <p>
        To strengthen my wall of emotional and mental wellbeing, I like to play
        badminton as it is my favorite sport which makes me happy and relieves
        stress. Going out to eat my favourite foods that I usually don't have is
        also something I enjoy.

      <h3>Spiritual</h3>
      <p>
        To strengthen my wall of spiritual wellbeing, I like to stick to my
        beliefs and values instead of blindly following things without purpose,
        which helps set my own identity.
      </p>

      <h3>Foundation</h3>
      <p>
        To strengthen my connection to my environment, I like to quietly take in
        what's happening around my backyard. Many birds such as Tūī often visit,
        and they all have their unique calls and behaviours. It's really
        interesting to listen and watch while they fly around, look for food, or
        just sit there.
