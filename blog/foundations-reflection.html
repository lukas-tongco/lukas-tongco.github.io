        Three new things I learned about myself and my ego because of Human
        Skills learning are the importance of self-awareness, strengthening my
        emotional intelligence, and maintaining a growth mindset. They all help
        me manage my wellbeing and efficiency with work and collaboration.

      <p>
        The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming is to guide our decisions and actions in order to stay true
        to what's important to us, to be able to understand others such as our
        team, and to help us identify what's working and what's going wrong.

        What surprised me the most about the Human Skills learning is
        significant it is in making things work both in personal and work life.
        If your technical skills is the bridge, then your human skills would be
        the supports holding it up.

        The most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning were being
        honest about myself without being biased. I had to look at myself as if
        I was someone else in order to self-reflect properly.

        I think Dev Academy is spending so much time focusing on Human Skills
        learning in a web dev Bootcamp course because a tech job isn't all about
        coding. There's teamwork and collaboration involved, client interaction,
        etc. which all require human skills.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The time I spent studying Human Skills learning here didn't feel like a
        waste of time because it can be applied to jobs in other industries and
        even to just my personal life.
